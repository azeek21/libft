# libft
Very first project at School 21 to mimic behaviour of some functions of standart C library.

I made my own library to use in future projects. It contains some standart stdlib functions and some additional ones.
Rule make will compile all the standart functions and additonal ones. 
Rule make bonus will add some other functions to work with lists.

I tested them with Testers by ska42
